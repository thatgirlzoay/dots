dots for my linux mint i3 setup :3

## Overview

## Note
This is my config for my needs, I have commented out anything that wont work straight away (e.g. launch saved workspace layouts)<br>
Files such as workspace layouts and start sctipts will be included if you would like to use them.

If you are confused about saving and loading workplace layouts, read threw this [i3 doc](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html), also the [arch wiki on i3](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3#Save_and_restore_the_window_layout) has info on it.
