# Dots
Files for my arch i3 setup :3

## Overview
- Distro: Arch
- WM: i3wm

- Composer: picom
- App Launcher: rofi
- Lockscreen: betterlockscreen (working on config)
- Bar: Polybar
- File Manager: ranger
- File Manager (GUI): Dolphin

## Note
This is my config for my needs, I have commented out anything that wont work straight away (e.g. launch saved workspace layouts)<br>
Files such as workspace layouts and start sctipts will be included if you would like to use them.<br>

If you are confused about saving and loading workplace layouts, read threw this [i3 doc](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html), also the [arch wiki on i3](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3#Save_and_restore_the_window_layout) has info on it.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsibe if you screw up setting up this (It would be really hard too)
